Description : The program gets the input of two bases of a trapezoid as well as
a character symbol to draw a trapezoid. Returns the calculated area of the trapezoid.

Algorithmic design

Get the input of an odd integer between 1-21
validate base1
Keep asking for input if invalid

Get the input of an odd integer between 3-23
validate base2
Keep asking for input if invalid

Get the input of a character

Draw the trapezoid

Calculate the area by using the area formula.


functions:

{
Validate base 1
check if odd
check range

Validate base 2
check if odd
check range
check if greater than base 1
}
combine these into one function, "validate_base," that only checks odd and range.
can input base1 as minimum for range of base2.

area
1/2 * (b1 + b2) * h

draw trapezoid
Draw rows of the character, increasing by two each time starting from the first to the second integer.
Calculate the difference divided by two to determine the number of rows.
Add that many spaces for the first row, then print the row of characters
decrease the number of spaces by one every time you print a row
