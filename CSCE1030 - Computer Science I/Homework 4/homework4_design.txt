1. print student info using function
2. Determine whether we're encrypting or decrypting
3. set the boolean to the corresponding choice
4. prompt for input filename
5. prompt for output filename
6. If there are no errors, then process the files and continue with the encryption using a function.

void print_student_info();
  prints my info

void process(ifstream& fin, ofstream& fout, bool is_encrypting)
  get every character in the file
    if its not a blank

      if its a letter
        if its uppercase
          if we're encrypting
            encrypt the capital letter
          else (decrypting)
            decrypt the capital letter

        if lowercase
          if we're encrypting
            encrypt the lower letter
          else
            decrypt the lower letter

    if a letter was changed, move to the next letter of the key
    if we're at the end of the key, go back to the beginning


  always write the letter to the file.
  note that if the letter is blank, no action is performed and the space is just written
