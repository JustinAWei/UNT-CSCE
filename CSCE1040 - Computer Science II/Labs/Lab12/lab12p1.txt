Before I changed the function to virtual, the derived class called the parent version of Payment(), just returning sal (1500).
When I changed the function to virtual, the derived class called it's own version of Payment(), returning sal * inc (2500).
Because the derived keyword uses runtime-binding, it is able to call the derived function from a parent pointer to a derived class.
